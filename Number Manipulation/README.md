This is the tutorial of the number manipulation 

we have:
1. +num;
2. num.parseInt();
3. num.parseFloat();
4. num.isNaN();


+num:
this is helping us to change the string that has the numbers only to the data type number.

num.parseInt():
this helps us to change the given string that has some numbers in it at starting of the string to the number data type. 
if there is any character in between the numbers it is changing the string to  number up to the point where it finds the character then it stops. it cannot work with the decimals.

num.parseFloat():
this helps us to change the string data type to number data type which has number in it. it has similar functions as parseInt() but it can work with the decimals.

num.isNaN():
this helps us to find out whether the given data type number is data type number or not.
this gives the output in boolean type: true or false
